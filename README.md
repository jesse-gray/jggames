1. In your PHP

1. Rename file to your desired app name. Test by going to localhost/"app name". This should put you on the WatsonMVC landing page.

1. Open in your prefered IDE and navigate to app/config/config.php. Edit the default values to your values. See below.

    
        <?php
        // DB Params
        define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');                       <-- Default host used
        define('DB_USER', 'root');
        define('DB_PASS', '123456');                          <-- Database password you created earlier
        define('DB_NAME', 'wmvc');                            <-- Database name you created earlier

        // App Root
        define('APPROOT', dirname(dirname(__FILE__)));
        // URL Root
        define('URLROOT', 'http://localhost/watsonmvc');      <-- Your default URL. This is generally localhost/<file name>

        RewriteBase /watsonmvc/public

        Change to:

        RewriteBase /<your app name>/public
